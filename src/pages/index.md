### Add a restaurant

1. Click on the Add restaurant button on top right corner
2. Enter details about your restaurant. Although some fields here are optional, we recommend that you complete the form as this information is displayed to your customers.

   {% /callout %}
3. Click on create button.

Now you should be back on the all-restaurants screen. And the new restaurant should be visible with an `inactive` badge.
