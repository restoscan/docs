In order to effectively use restoscan, you must understand different 
- types of order
- states of an order

## Types of orders

Restoscan supports 2 types of orders and shows them seperately on the orders screen for easy management. These types are:
- take-away orders
- dine-in orders

### Take-away orders

Any orders created without a table assignment are considered take-away orders. 

### Dine-in orders

Any orders created with a table assignment are considered as dine-in orders.

### Switching between the two

You can switch between the two. For example, let's say one customer ordered a take-away, then wishes to sit on a table after receiving the order. You can assign a table to the customer using the take-away order. This we you can convert a take-away to a dine-in.
You can also mark a dine-in order as take-away. This might help in scenarios where you are rushed and need to clear a table asap.

## Managing order states

We know that it's vital to monitor changes in order status to ensure a great customer experience. Therefore, the dashboard is designed to indicate the number of orders in each state.
There are 2 types of order states:
- Payment states (paid, or unpaid)
- Preparation states (pending confirmation, being prepared, served, or cancelled)


### Take an order

1. Navigate to restaurant dashboard
2. Click on orders page (this is the default tab when you navigate to restaurant dashboard).
   From this page you can create take-away and dine-in orders (if you have a table).
3. Click on cart/new order button of the widget for which you want to create the order.
4. Select items for the order

Now you must be back on the order tab in restaurant dashboard.

### Changing order states

You can manage orders table-wise. Each table you create is visible on the orders tab in restaurant dashboard. For dine-in orders, click the manage button for the table you want to manage.
